What I want to do:
- make it work fast and dirty.

what do i want to make work fast and dirty?

the whole nba app.

but what to start with? should we do DB first of getting the bet as a form or should wemake the functionality work for being able to choose your bet in the future, like what do i want to have it do? the hardest possibly will have the team that's chosen automatically shown in the thing but i want for it to work and later i'll improve functionality. first make it work. how can i make it work? have a scroll down thing with all the 16 teams (later i can improve but for now just have a dropdown! in this dropdown there will be 16 teams in the nba playoffs and then you can choose the team that's playing and then add in the score you want to give and then hit submit and get a ordered thing in the db.
i think i should deal with the db later.

i should just deal with the functionality.
